This project was made for a class in college
Essentially what it does it creates a random maze with a dimension of the input parameters 
Then will take the maze and solve how to to the end
There is an example of the finished maze as maze.ps this was a 50 50 maze
The maze solve goes from top left to bottom right also will find all the dead ends that you checked along the path
I am not sure how well this will play on windows if it will at all.
Was working of 2.25.21 when i tested on my personal ubuntu machine
